# yayum version
so one of my friends wanted a version of the 2048 AI except every move it made, it would have the monke.mp3 audio play at a pitch proportional to the highest tile combined (i.e. 2 is low pitch, 4 is higher, ..., 2048 is highest)
sounds would overlap so at the current pace of moves, it would sound like an army of loud angry monkeys screaming at different pitches

also replace tile faces with monkey tiles resized to squares
